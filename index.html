      Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits.
      They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores.
      Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys
      ,and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups
      Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes,
      so cladistically they are fish as well.However, traditionally fish are
      rendered paraphyletic      Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits.

     Sheep (Ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock.
     Like most ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed
     ungulates. Although the name sheep applies to many species in the genus Ovis,
     in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries.
     Numbering a little over one billion,
     domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep
